    "A class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that operate on those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes: These are the variables within the class that hold the data or state. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and speed.\n",
