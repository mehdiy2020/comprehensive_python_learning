    "## Object-Oriented Programming with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (member functions) that operate on those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes: These are the variables within the class that hold the data or state. For example, a Car class might have attributes like color and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods: These are the functions within the class that define the behaviors of the objects. For example, a Car class might have methods like accelerate() and brake().\n",
    "\n",
    "Object (or Instance): An object is a specific, <span style='color: lightgreen;'>concrete instance of a class</span>. The class is the mold, and the object is the brick created from the mold. You can create many objects from a single class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are the core component of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They help manage complexity and promote better code organization through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that work on that data into a single unit (the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Hiding the complex internal implementation details and showing only the necessary features to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Allowing a new class to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Allowing methods to take different forms or behave differently in various contexts."
