    "1. What is a Package?\n",
    "A package is essentially a directory containing a special file named __init__.py (even if it's empty). Packages organize related modules (individual Python files) into a logical hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy: Packages define a precise path for Python to navigate using dots (e.g., my_project.utils.helpers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is a Module?\n",
    "A module is simply a single Python file (e.g., helpers.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "the difference between the <b>file system hierarchy</b> and the <b>Python package hierarchy </b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐍 Understanding Python Imports: Absolute vs. Relative\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental goal of any import statement is to tell Python where to find the code you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Absolute Imports (Always Preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "An absolute import uses the full, explicit path to the module or package, starting from the project root (a directory on the sys.path)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Syntax: `from package_name.subpackage.module import function` \n",
    "- ### When to Use:\n",
    "Always use absolute imports when importing code from another branch or top-level package within your project, or when importing an installed third-party library. They make the source location clear and unambiguous.\n",
    "- ### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python# Project structure: ProjectRoot/utils/helpers.py\n",
    "from utils import helpers # Assumes ProjectRoot is on sys.path\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Relative Imports (Package Navigation Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "A relative import specifies the path based on the current module's known location within its package structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Syntax:\n",
    "Uses dots (. or ..) to move up or down the package hierarchy.\n",
    "- ### When to Use: \n",
    "Only use them for importing a module that is close by (a sibling or a direct parent/child) within the same package.\n",
    "- ### Requirement: They only work if the file being executed is imported as a module,\n",
    "meaning it must have a non-None __package__ attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚫ When and Where Dots (. and ..) Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The single dot (.) and double dot (..) are navigational tools within a defined package structure. They only \"work\" when Python knows the starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your current file is: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ProjectRoot/my_app/reports/data_report.py\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbol\t   Meaning\t              Package String Resolution   \tFile System Path\t    When Does it Work?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "..\t   Parent Package (One level up)\tResolves to 'my_app'\t/my_app/\t                When importing a module or package from the immediate parent directory. Example: from .. import config_module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative Import\t                  Where Python Looks\n",
    "from . helpers import clean_data\tLooks in the current package: my_app/reports/helpers.py\n",
    "from .. utils import load_data\t  Looks one level up (my_app), then into the utils subpackage: my_app/utils/load_data.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ When and Why Relative Imports Fail\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative imports fail due to ambiguity when Python cannot establish the current module's position in the package hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Failure Rule: Execution as Main Script\n",
    "\n",
    "If you execute a file directly (e.g., python data_report.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The file's __name__ is set to '__main__' (The file is the entry point).\n",
    "2. The file's __package__ is set to None.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Why __package__ is None: The Core Reason\n",
    "\n",
    "Python sets __package__ to None because running a file directly treats it as an isolated script, not as part of an organized package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Ambiguity: Python cannot guess where your project's root is just by seeing a file path (e.g., is the root /home/user/code/ or /home/user/code/project/?).\n",
    "- The Impossible Calculation: Without a starting package name (a non-None __package__), Python cannot calculate the meaning of . or ... It cannot resolve \"one package up\" or \"the current package\" from an undefined starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the error: ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package.The SolutionTo make the dots work, you must execute the program from a higher-level script (like a run.py file) that uses absolute imports to load your package. This tells Python the correct hierarchy and sets the essential __package__ attribute correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If I run run.py (which is in /dashboard_project_root/), and it has from . import dashboard, shouldn't the single dot (.) just resolve to the current directory (/dashboard_project_root/) and find the dashboard folder?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The answer is no, it doesn't work that way, and that's exactly why the error occurs. here, the file system path diverges from the Python package path!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relative Imports Ignore the FIle System Path\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees the . operator, it does not look at the operating system's current working directory (which is where run.py lives). Instead, it looks for the value of the special variable __package__.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Values in run.pyWhen you execute python run.py:\n",
    "- __name__ is set to '__main__'.\n",
    "- __package__ is set to None.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Impossible Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The relative import `from . import dashboard` requires Python to perform this calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Current Package (which is None) + \"dot\"(.) = New Package Path`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the starting point (__package__) is None, the operation is mathematically and logically impossible for the Python interpreter to resolve into a valid package string.\n",
